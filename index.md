## Work History

### Advanced Research Engineer / Data Scientist  
**James Hardie Building Products, R&D** – Fontana, CA  
*May 2022 – Present*  
- Led analytics initiatives by developing a prototype data pipeline that connected directly to third-party APIs for MLS housing, economic, and census data—automating market analysis while reducing reliance on vendor reports, cutting costs, and enabling more proactive decision-making.  
- Built a scalable API framework in Python around a tuned Azure AI vision model to classify home exteriors, enabling granular market sizing and insights at the zip code level for new products.  
- Applied image preprocessing techniques in R to detect surface defects. Performed pixel-level analysis using unsupervised clustering to quantify and classify defects, enabling insights into recurring manufacturing issues.  
- Partnered with product, commercial insights, and research teams to implement data-informed decisions across initiatives.  

### Industrial Engineer  
**Polar Power** – Gardena, CA  
*May 2021 – May 2022*  
- Applied operations research techniques through discrete-event simulation in ProModel to evaluate production scenarios, optimizing layout, material flow, and resource allocation.  
- Designed and implemented a modular assembly line based on simulation results, increasing throughput by 13% while improving scalability and reducing bottlenecks.  
- Led the redesign of a generator cooling system by implementing a new fan, radiator, exhaust, and reengineered enclosure to improve airflow and ensure engine cooling under high-stress conditions—resulting in product certification and readiness for market launch.  

### Manufacturing Engineer  
**Global Environmental Products** – San Bernardino, CA  
*August 2018 – April 2021*  
- Used R to analyze cycle time data across multiple stages of the manufacturing process, identifying bottlenecks and line balancing issues, and recommending design changes to improve overall efficiency.  
- Developed a real-time data collection system using RFID sensors to automatically track and timestamp products throughout different stages of the manufacturing process.
